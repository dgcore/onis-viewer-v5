## 📈 Metrics Tracking

### Automated Metrics

#### Code Coverage
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Generate coverage report
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
```

#### Code Complexity
```bash
# Analyze Dart complexity
dart analyze --fatal-infos

# C++ complexity (requires additional tools)
# clang-tidy, cppcheck, etc.
```

#### Performance Metrics
```bash
# Profile Flutter app
flutter run --profile

# Memory profiling
flutter run --trace-startup
```
